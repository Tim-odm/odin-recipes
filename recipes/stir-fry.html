    Chicken stir fry is another easy, nutrient dense meal you can add to your 
    cooking arsenal. Just like shrimp pasta, it takes less than 
    <strong> 20 minutes </strong>
    to prepare, but it tastes delicious and can easily be saved for a later meal.
    Stir fry is aslo easily customizable, you can add and remove vegetables as 
    you please as long as you have the all important
    <em> soy sauce </em>
    that gives this 
    dish its unique flavour you're ready to go.
